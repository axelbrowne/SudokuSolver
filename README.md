Made as the final project in SLU Madrid's CSCI 3200 Programming Languages course.

[Video Explanation](https://youtu.be/lGfdaoLvjVU?t=1832)

## Description
sudoku.pl is a program that takes Sudoku puzzles as input, and outputs their solution
using constraint logic propagation from the CLP(FD) library and labelling.
Secondarily, the program can give a difficulty rating of the input puzzle based on
different solving techniques.
